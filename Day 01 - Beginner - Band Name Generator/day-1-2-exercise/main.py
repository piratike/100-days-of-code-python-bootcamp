# Code for Day 1, Exercise 2

# Don't have the initial double quotes
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")

# The + symbol must be surounded by different quotes or
# put a backslah before the double quotes like this:
print("String Concatenation is done with the \"+\" sign.")

# The indentation was wrong
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')

# There was an extra openning '('
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
